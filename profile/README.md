# Summary

SONGS aims to simplify the music creation process from idea to market. It acknowledges the current model's deep layers and historic foundations, while aspiring to streamline the journey from an artistic idea to a final, consumable song. Efforts to improve this process have been made.

Our goal as participants of the current music model is to set the foundations for a deep simplification of it. Permitting a closer relationship between the artists (creators) and the fans (music consumers) 
The intention is not to redesign the whole actual modu-operandi but to identify the value-adding stakeholders of the current model and making the rails to deeply improve all of them creating incentives via lowering costs and standardisation of procedures that were not possible before via the actual available technology. But, without assuming that the old procedures are going to fade away.

# Open Music Distribution Protocol

### Goals:

- Enable artists to upload their music directly to streaming services without intermediaries, receiving the generated revenue directly in their wallets.
- Automate the distribution of song profits among creators.
- Improve the efficiency of label-artist relationships automating their conectivity and enforcing transparency.
- Allow artists to sell their digital phonographic distribution rights (we prefer to called it Songshares) to fans, enabling them to receive advances through their fans or any other entity with access to the protocol (a privilege traditionally reserved for record labels).


For a better platform for music.
